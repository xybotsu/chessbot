### Installation

Basic setup requires a Slack bot token. A Redis instance is also required, which is set up for you if you're running on Heroku. Once the bot is online, enter a channel with it and say `chess help` to see the command list.

### Configuration

Tarrasch is configured through environment variables.

* `TARRASCH_MESSAGE_PREFIX`: Set the word Tarrasch listens for at the beginning of your messages to know you're talking to it. Default: `chess`.
* `TARRASCH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`: Number of seconds to wait after each move before accepting another move. Default: `0`.

There are also various `TARRASCH_REDIS_*` variables for configuring the Redis connection, but if you're deployed on Heroku this should Just Workâ„¢.

#### Interaction Model

To keep things simple, Tarrasch can manage one game per channel it is in. The recommended way of playing a game is to invite your opponent and Tarrasch to a group DM. You can also play in public channels if you want an audience, but only one game can go on in that channel at a time.

#### Using Heroku Free Dynos

You'll need to take Tarrasch offline for 6 hours a day if you plan to deploy it on Heroku free dynos. See the [scaling](scaling.md) doc for more information.
